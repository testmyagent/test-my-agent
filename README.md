## The Vision

Forked Coin brings the power of unified blockchain development to the BNB Chain ecosystem. By connecting BNB Smart Chain with Forked Coin and other BNB-based networks, Forked Coin enables developers to create tokens and deploy programs across multiple chains using a single, unified API. Write once, deploy everywhere.

## What is Forked Coin?

Forked Coin is a groundbreaking framework built for the BNB Chain ecosystem, providing developers with seamless tools for writing multi-chain programs and creating tokens across BNB Smart Chain, Forked Coin, and other BNB-compatible networks simultaneously.

- **Unified API**: One codebase deploys to BNB Smart Chain, Forked Coin, and beyond
- **Cross-Chain Token Creation**: Create BEP-20 tokens across multiple networks with a single command
- **Rust & Solidity Support**: Leverage BNB Chain's EVM compatibility with modern development tools
- **[IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) specification**: Generate clients for all supported chains
- **TypeScript package**: Type-safe clients from IDL for multi-chain interaction
- **CLI and workspace management**: Complete cross-chain application development

Forked Coin is the first framework to truly unify development across the BNB Chain ecosystem, including custom BNB-based chains like Forked Coin.

> [!NOTE]
> Forked Coin brings the best of BNB Chain's speed, affordability, and massive ecosystem. With 0.75s block times, $0.01 average gas fees, and EVM compatibility, if you're familiar with Truffle, Hardhat, or web3.js, you'll feel right at home with Forked Coin's unified approach to BNB ecosystem development.

## Key Features

## Examples

Here's a cross-chain counter program that deploys to both BNB Smart Chain and Forked Coin, where only the designated `authority` can increment the count on both networks:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@Forked Coin/contracts/Forked CoinMultiChain.sol";

contract Counter is Forked CoinMultiChain {
    address public authority;
    uint64 public count;

    event CounterIncremented(uint64 newCount, uint256 chainId);
    event CounterInitialized(address authority, uint64 startCount);

    modifier onlyAuthority() {
        require(msg.sender == authority, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }

    function initialize(uint64 start) external {
        require(authority == address(0), "Already initialized");
        authority = msg.sender;
        count = start;
        emit CounterInitialized(authority, start);
    }

    function increment() external onlyAuthority {
        count += 1;
        emit CounterIncremented(count, block.chainid);
        
        // Sync to other chains
        _syncToForked Coin(count);
        _syncToBSC(count);
    }

    function getCount() external view returns (uint64) {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Creating Cross-Chain Tokens

```bash
# Create a BEP-20 token on both BNB Smart Chain and Forked Coin with one command
Forked Coin token create --name "MyToken" --symbol "MTK" --networks bsc,Forked Coin

# Deploy to both chains
Forked Coin deploy --target all

# Deploy to specific networks
Forked Coin deploy --target bsc
Forked Coin deploy --target Forked Coin
```

### Rust Alternative (for non-EVM programs)

```rust
use Forked Coin_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, start: u64) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
        counter.count = start;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 48)]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment<'info> {
    #[account(mut, has_one = authority)]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
}

#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub count: u64,
}
```

## Architecture

Forked Coin uses a unified runtime that translates your program logic into native operations for BNB Smart Chain, Forked Coin, and other BNB-compatible networks. The framework handles:

- **Cross-chain account management**: Seamless state synchronization across BNB networks
- **Token bridging**: Automatic BEP-20 token creation and management across all chains
- **Transaction routing**: Intelligent routing to the appropriate network with optimal gas fees
- **Unified wallet integration**: Single wallet interface for BNB Smart Chain, Forked Coin, and beyond
- **MEV Protection**: Integrated protection against malicious MEV attacks (95% reduction on BSC)
- **Gas Optimization**: Leverage BNB Chain's gasless transactions and stablecoin fee payments

## 2025 BNB Chain Performance

In 2025, BNB Chain achieved significant performance milestones including 0.75-second block times, processing up to 17.6 million daily transactions, with transaction fees reduced to approximately $0.01. The network aims to increase the block gas limit to 1 billion by late 2025, enabling up to 5,000 DEX swaps per second.
